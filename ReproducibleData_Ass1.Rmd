## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document, developed for the Coursera course "Reproducible Research".Based on the following characteristics of the data.

Now is possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.  

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip  
*Activity monitoring data [52K] *

* The variables included in this dataset are:
* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
  
## Loading and preprocessing the data
Set the working directory, downloading and unzipping the file to "step_data.csv".
```{r load data}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE)
library(ggplot2)

setwd("C:/Users/ALs/Desktop/Coursera/CourseraCienciaDatosR/05_Reproducible Research/Assesment1")
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
destfile <- "step_data.zip"
download.file(url, destfile)

unzip(destfile)

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", sep = ",")
```
The the structure and variable names of the file are:
```{r activity details}
names(activity)
str(activity)
head(activity[which(!is.na(activity$steps)), ]) # data set with NA rows removed
```
Now the file is ready for analysis.


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
* Group the number of steps by date and intervals.
* Find the total number of steps per day over all days.
* Remove N/A rows for this part.
#### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
```{r steps mean}
activity_total_steps <- with(activity, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(activity_total_steps) <- c("date", "steps")
hist(activity_total_steps$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Total steps taken per day", col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0,20), breaks = seq(0,25000, by=2500))
```

#### The summary of 'total number of steps per day'.
```{r total steps per day summary}
summary(activity_total_steps$steps)
```
#### The maen of 'total number of steps per day'.
```{r mean steps per day summary}
mean(activity_total_steps$steps)
```
#### The median of 'total number of steps per day'.
```{r median steps per day summary}
median(activity_total_steps$steps)
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?
In this section, we make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken averaged across all days.

```{r time series plot}
average_daily_activity <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
names(average_daily_activity) <- c("interval", "mean")

plot(average_daily_activity$interval, average_daily_activity$mean, type = "l", col="darkblue", lwd = 2, xlab="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps", main="Average number of steps per intervals")
```

The time interval during which the maximum number of steps is taken is
```{r max steps}
average_daily_activity[which.max(average_daily_activity$mean), ]$interval
```

## Imputing missing values
First of all, let us get a sense for the missing values. Are there days with all time intervals reporting NA step values? 


#### Calculate the number of rows with NA values
```{r NA row num}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```
#### Percentage of rows with missing values
```{r NA row num percent}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))*100/nrow(activity) 
```

Replace the missing data for a day by the time average over all other days. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data
```{r steps mean2}
imputed_steps <- average_daily_activity$mean[match(activity$interval, average_daily_activity$interval)]
activity_imputed <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = activity$steps))
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_imputed, sum)
names(total_steps_imputed) <- c("date", "daily_steps")
```


#### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day with the imputed missing values.
```{r total step per day histogram2}
hist(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps, col = "darkblue", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), main = "Total number of steps taken each day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))
abline(v = mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps), lty = 1, lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps), lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = "black")
legend(x = "topright", c("Mean", "Median"), col = c("red", "black"), lty = c(2, 1), lwd = c(2, 2))
```

#### The maen of 'total number of steps per day'.
```{r mean total steps per day summary}
mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
```
#### The median of 'total number of steps per day'.
```{r median total steps per day summary}
median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new column describing if the date is a weekday or weekend.
```{r weekday status}
activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activity$datetype <- sapply(activity$date, function(x) {
        if (weekdays(x) == "Saturday" | weekdays(x) =="Sunday") 
                {y <- "Weekend"} else 
                {y <- "Weekday"}
                y
        })
```

Steps taken over each interval averaged across weekday days and weekend days.
```{r plot diferents }
activity_by_date <- aggregate(steps~interval + datetype, activity, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(activity_by_date, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = datetype)) +
       geom_line() + facet_wrap(~datetype, ncol = 1, nrow=2) +
       labs(title = "Average daily steps by type of date", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of steps")

```









```{r graphic_ini, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE, results="hide")
``` 

```{r plot_save diferents }
